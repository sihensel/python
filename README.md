# python
This repo contains my own little Python projects, which I work on from time to time.

Inside the InfoSec folder you can find a few small tools regarding IT secutiry.

The RPG-folder contains a text based game (or at least the idea of it.)

Feel free to use any of the Python scripts in your own programs, if you consider them useful.
